    <h5>Innovation Labs, Innovation Institute (Jan 2020 - Present)</h5>
    <br>
    <p> Working at Innovation Labs, I was part of the Front-End team that took care of developing a web application that stored and displayed data on the noise being recorded in hospitals.
      The project we worked on was to monitor and track noise levels within the rooms in hospitals using a wall hardware that sent decibel (noise) levels to a database. 
      I worked on retrieving the data using API calls and displaying it in historical and real time data charts. React was the primary framework used to complete the project.

    <br>
    <p> At Internet Marketing Footprints, I was in charge of developing and maintaining the different sites the company had to market their online services. 
      I redesigned and rebuilt their old Wix website using HTMl, CSS, and Javascript. I added new features to the site such as a search feature and a contact form users can fill out to 
      send companies personal messages. I also created their blog site Au'loni Magazine using Wordpress that kept users up to date on articles about the company.

      <h5>UX Design Student, Team Treehouse (Oct 2019 - Jan 2020)</h5>
      <br>
      <p>Throughout my boot camp I learned many concepts on user-centered design when creating both web and mobile applications with user personas, empathy maps, which eventually led to wireframes and mockups.
        I was able to acquire basic knowledge in various tools such as Adobe XD to build wireframes and prototypes suited for the needs of clients. 
        When gathering user input, user surveys and tests were conducted to get qualitative and quantitative data for each iteration of the design process.</p>

        I built websites with a mobile-first approach like a registration form and a photo gallery from scratch using HTML, and implemented interactive elements using CSS and JavaScript.
        Explored and learned different web development technologies and frameworks such as Sass, jQuery, and Bootstrap to build API-based employee directories and a web app dashboard.</p>
